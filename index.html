            Have you ever visited a grocery shop, supermarket or bakery/sandwich shop in a foreign country and noticed a new and unfamiliar drink? 
            <br> Did you wonder what it was or tasted like? 
            <br> <br> Faced repetitively with such situation, I decided to create this application: The Soda Identifier. 
            <br> <br> The aim is to identify a drink based on an uploaded picture one may have taken or a live video (best from a phone). 
            <br> My pre-trained AI model should detect and provide its best guess of the drink, together by providing the user with links to gather more information as well as links to videos of reviewers. 
            <br> <br> You can access the picture upload function by clicking on the "Image Identifier" button above or the live video function by clicking on the "Video Identifier" also above.
            <br> <br> <b> Note: At this stage, the AI model has only been trained on a selected number of German soda (12 in total). More soda will be added to improve the accuracy and completeness of the app.</b>
